## Active Tasks (In Priority Order)

### G5: Fix Weekly Events Auto-Update Workflow üî•
**Priority:** High | **Effort:** Low (1-2 hours) | **Impact:** Operational reliability, user experience

**Problem:**
- Current GitHub workflow runs Monday 04:05 UTC (Monday morning ET)
- Should run Sunday night to prepare for new week
- Not reliably triggering weekly updates
- Better automation approach needed

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Review current workflow (`.github/workflows/update-events-and-deploy.yml`)
- [ ] Update cron schedule to run Sunday night ET (23:00 ET Sunday = Monday 04:00 UTC during DST, 05:00 UTC during EST)
- [ ] Consider alternative approaches:
  - [ ] On-demand rebuilds via webhook from Supabase
  - [ ] Netlify scheduled functions
  - [ ] Manual trigger + better monitoring
- [ ] Add workflow monitoring/alerting for failures
- [ ] Test workflow execution and verify weekly updates
- [ ] Document the automation approach

**Files Affected:**
- `.github/workflows/update-events-and-deploy.yml`
- `scripts/export-json.mjs` (verify it works correctly)
- Consider adding workflow status checks

**Alternative Approaches:**
1. **Webhook from Supabase** - Trigger rebuild when data changes (best for real-time)
2. **Netlify Scheduled Functions** - Run on Netlify's infrastructure (simpler than GitHub Actions)
3. **Improved GitHub Actions** - Better cron timing, error handling, notifications

## Decisions & Patterns

### Design Token Usage
- **Preferred:** Use Tailwind utilities with token-mapped colors (`bg-brand-600`, `text-gray-800`)
- **Token Mapping:** Design tokens (brand-*, gray-*) mapped in `tailwind.config.js`
- **Avoid:** Legacy `.ccs-*` classes (deprecated, migration complete)

### Component Patterns
- **Containers:** Always use `Container` component for page wrappers
- **Breadcrumbs:** Use `Breadcrumbs` component for navigation context
- **Event Cards:** Use `EventListCard` for all list views (standard component)
- **Metadata:** Always include complete metadata object per page

### SEO Patterns
- **Canonical URLs:** Always include, use absolute URLs
- **Open Graph:** Include title, description, image, URL for all pages
- **JSON-LD:** Include relevant schema (Event, Organization, ItemList) ‚Äî standardized ‚úÖ
- **Structured Data:** Validate with Google Rich Results Test

### Data Loading
- **Runtime:** Use `loadEvents()` for dynamic data
- **Static:** Export to JSON for build-time generation
- **Search Index:** Generate on build via `build:search-index` script

## Recent Changes & Rollbacks

### October 30, 2025 - Venue Slug Normalization Rollback
**Status:** Rolled back to commit `25478d7` ("last push of the night?")

**Action Taken:**
- Recent venue slug normalization work (commits `6f18f30` through `312c98e`) was rolled back
- Changes saved to branch `venue-slug-changes` for future reference
- Main branch restored to stable state before venue slug work began
- Site successfully rebuilt and deployed from rollback commit

**Reason for Rollback:**
- Venue slug normalization changes in `lib/data.ts` were causing build issues on Netlify
- Site was showing 404s on both Netlify subdomain and primary domain
- TypeScript errors in `normalizeEvents` function (venue variable scope issues)
- Rolling back to ensure site stability

**Next Steps:**
- Venue slug work can be revisited later if needed (changes preserved on branch)
- Focus on stable features and existing functionality
- Continue with high-value tasks that don't affect data normalization

---

## Next Steps

1. Continue Stage 1: Foundation & Standardization (documentation, cursor rules)
2. Complete Stage 2: Core Features Enhancement (performance optimization, accessibility browser audits)
3. Fix G5: Weekly Events Auto-Update Workflow (high priority)
4. Set up tracking for progress on each checkbox
5. Schedule regular reviews of high-value pages
