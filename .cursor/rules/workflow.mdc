## Pre-Push Checklist
Before pushing to main/Netlify, see `Docs/Pre_Push_Checklist.md` for full checklist.

**Quick validation:**
```bash
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm validate:jsonld
```

**Required checks:**
- [ ] `pnpm lint` passes
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` passes
- [ ] `pnpm validate:jsonld` — review JSON-LD pages
- [ ] `pnpm build` succeeds
- [ ] Test JSON-LD after Netlify deploy with Google Rich Results Test

## PR Checklist
- Linked issue or PRD section.
- Lint + typecheck + unit tests pass.
- Screenshots for UI, `curl` for API, or task-runner output.
- DB change? Include migration + rollback plan.
- JSON-LD changes? Validate with `pnpm validate:jsonld` and test after deploy.

## Local DB
- Use `.env.local` for DATABASE_URL.

## CI
- Steps: install → typecheck → lint → unit tests → build → `prisma migrate deploy`.
- For e2e: spin ephemeral Postgres, run seeds, Playwright tests.

## Releases
- Tag with `vX.Y.Z`; generate changelog from Conventional Commits.
